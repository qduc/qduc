# Hi there 👋

I'm a developer who started out in the PHP world and gradually wandered across the whole stack. These days I work comfortably with:

- **Frontend:** React, Vue  
- **Backend:** PHP, TypeScript, Python  
- **Infrastructure & DevOps:** from server basics to cloud automation

I love exploring AI — especially large language models and the ways they can act as real programming agents. That curiosity has led me into projects like:

- Setting up **real-time ASR** pipelines using Whisper  
- Fine-tuning **OpenAI** and **Gemini** models for translation tasks  
- Building and maintaining **high-availability systems**  
- Working with **AWS Lambda** using the SAM framework

I also have a strong foundation in **UNIX-like operating systems**, which keeps everything grounded and smooth behind the scenes.

If you’re into AI, scalable backend infra, or just tinkering with clever systems, you’re in the right place.  
Thanks for stopping by!
